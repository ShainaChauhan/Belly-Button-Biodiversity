# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
In this assignment, I have built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Diversity Dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.Below is the link of the Dashboard:
